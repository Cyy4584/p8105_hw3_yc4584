- A short discription: There are 2595176 rows and 7 columns in this data
  frame. The data frame contains the information of the weather in New
  York from January 1, 1981 through December 31, 2010. The key variables
  are “date”, “temperature_min”, “temperature_max”, “precipitation”,
  “snowfall”, “snow_depth”. In all of the variables, the “prcp”, “snow”
  and “snwd” variables are numeric variables and the “tmax”, “tmin” and
  “id” are recognized as character variables. However, I would prefer to
  transfer “tman” and “tmin” into numeric characters. The missing data
  in every column is shown in the following table. id date prcp snow
  snwd tmax tmin 0 0 145838 381221 591786 1134358 1134420 We can see
  that there are around half of the data missing in the “tmax” and
  “tmin” columns. In “prcp”, “snow” and “snwd” columns, there are less
  data missing, but still a large amount of data missing.

Question 1: - Create separate variables for year, month, and day

``` r
ny_noaa = ny_noaa |> 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date))
```

- Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are
  given in reasonable units we want the units for “prcp”, “snow” and
  “snwd” to be tenths of mm, and the units for “tmax” and “tmin” to be
  in Celsius.

``` r
ny_noaa = ny_noaa |>
  mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax)) |>
  mutate(tmin = as.numeric(tmin)) |>
  mutate(
    prcp = ifelse(is.na(prcp), NA, prcp * 1/10),
    snow = ifelse(is.na(snow), NA, snow * 1/10),
    snwd = ifelse(is.na(snwd), NA, snwd * 1/10),
    tmax = ifelse(is.na(tmax), NA, (tmax - 32) * 5/9),
    tmin = ifelse(is.na(tmin), NA, (tmin - 32) * 5/9)
  )
```

- most commonly observed values for snowfall

``` r
common_snowfall = ny_noaa |> 
  count(snow) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))

print(common_snowfall)
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <dbl>   <int>
    ##  1   0   2008508
    ##  2  NA    381221
    ##  3   2.5   31022
    ##  4   1.3   23095
    ##  5   5.1   18274
    ##  6   7.6   10173
    ##  7   0.8    9962
    ##  8   0.5    9748
    ##  9   3.8    9197
    ## 10   0.3    8790
    ## # ℹ 272 more rows

We could find out that the most commonly observed value for snowfall is
0.0, which is 381221 times. I think this is because that snowfall is not
a daily occurrence in most regions. Many places experience long periods
without any snowfall, especially during non-winter months. Even in
regions where snow is common, there are often days when no snow falls.

Question2: - Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature
in January and in July in each station across years.

``` r
ny_noaa_filtered_plot = ny_noaa |> 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) |> 
  group_by(id, year, month) |> 
  summarize(avg_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_tmax)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Maximum Temperature in January and July",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Max Temperature (°C)"
  ) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
print(ny_noaa_filtered_plot)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 5970 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

- A short discription:Is there any observable / interpretable structure?
  Any outliers? From the plot, we could see that the average maximum
  temperature in January is lower than that in July. The average maximum
  temperature in July is more stable than that In January. There are
  some outliers in the plot, but they are not very significant. The
  outliers in the January plot are approximately equally distributed in
  the lower and higher parts of the plot. The outliers in the July plot
  are mainly distributed in the lower part of the plot.

Question3: - Part (i): tmax vs tmin plot using hexbin plot

``` r
p1 = ggplot(ny_noaa, aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(
    title = "tmax vs tmin",
    x = "Minimum Temperature (°C)",
    y = "Maximum Temperature (°C)",
    fill = "Count"
  ) 
print(p1)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 1136276 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_binhex()`).

<img src="p8105_hw3_yc4584_files/figure-gfm/tmax vs tmin plot-1.png" width="90%" />
Part (ii): Distribution of snowfall values \> 0 and \< 100, separated by
year

``` r
p2 = ny_noaa |> 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = snow)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Snowfall (0 < snowfall < 100)",
    x = "Snowfall (tenths of mm)",
    y = "Count"
  )
print(p2)
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
